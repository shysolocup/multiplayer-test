# Godot Coreblocks
A mini-engine built on top of Godot comprising core building blocks for multiplayer P2P games innovating on the service-based structure of Roblox

Coreblock improves upon Roblox's foundation by having Godot-specific systems
- built in scene-based map and lighting loading/saving
- multiple cameras with PhantomCamera
- accessible shaders (I'd recommend [https://godotshaders.com/](godotshaders.com) for resources)
- unified replicated and revamped scripts
- built-in discord rpc
- improved input systems
- custom classes and services
- extensive multiplayer API integration 
- UDim2 integrations
